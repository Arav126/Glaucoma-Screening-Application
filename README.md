# Glaucoma-Screening-Application
A web based application based on diseases detection.
This project is still in progress

Given the fundus image of the eye, an image processing model will tell if the person has glaucoma or not, the website is built on top of this idea with multiple different peripherials like an about page having precautionary measures to be taken and a records page that saves all past rercords and much more.
