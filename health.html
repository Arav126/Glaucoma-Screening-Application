                            rice, baked goods, pasta, and cereal should be avoided as they can worsen glaucoma.

                            Foods that contribute to metabolic syndrome, obesity, blood pressure abnormalities, and diabetes are risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).</p>

                        <p> Therefore, a diet that helps maintain normal blood pressure and blood glucose concentrations helps reduce substantial risk for glaucoma. Studies have also noted that an association may exist between obesity and elevated intra-ocular
                            pressure (IOP) and ocular hypertension. There is no evidence yet indicating that losing excess weight reduces the risk for glaucoma, although significant decreases in IOP have been reported in humans through weight loss. Diets
                            high in carbohydrates have also been correlated with a greater risk of glaucoma, while a lower intake of carbohydrates correlates with lesser risk.

                        B1, C, A, E, and B12 on glaucoma is mixed. Intake of vitamin B is thus recommended through dietary sources (meat, chicken, fish, tuna, salmon, citrus, banana, watermelon, avocados, potatoes, etc.), including green leafy vegetables, which may reduce the
                        risk of some types of glaucoma.

                            Do not overdo the caffeine. While coffee does hold antioxidants, too much caffeine can increase blood pressure, which is especially bad if you already have glaucoma. Drink lesser amounts of liquid throughout the day instead of larger quantities at one
                            time. Try to keep a low-calorie diet. </p>

                        <h2> Caffeine and Alcohol
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            An often-asked question is whether caffeine affects eye pressure and glaucoma. It is known that caffeine can cause a several point rise in eye pressure that lasts for at least 90 minutes. However, whether that increase is of concern is best addressed
                            between the patient and their eye doctor. A good rule of thumb is to exercise moderation with caffeine consumption. One cup of coffee is unlikely to cause any harm, but if you like to drink larger amounts of coffee consider
                            switching some of that consumption to decaffeinated. With regards to alcohol consumption, it is known that alcohol can lower eye pressure in the short term, but there is no data to suggest that drinking alcohol reduces the
                            risk of developing glaucoma or prevents its progression. As with almost everything, moderation is a good idea.

                        <h2> Antioxidants </h2>
                        <p>
                            As oxidative stress is thought to be an important feature of glaucoma, there have been several studies examining the relationship between antioxidant intake and glaucoma. In one prospective study, *no relationship was found between antioxidant intake,
                            such as carotenoids, vitamin C, vitamin E, and the risk of developing glaucoma. However, there are other large studies that have shown a possible relationship between the consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, such as green
                            leafy vegetables like kale and collards, and decreased glaucoma risk. In African-American women, there was a decreased risk of glaucoma with higher intake of certain fruits and vegetables high in vitamin A, vitamin C, and carotenoids.
                            However more research needs to be done in this field.
