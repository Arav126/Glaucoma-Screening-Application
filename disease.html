                    <p>
                        As we enter the 21st century, the growsing use of computers in the home and office brings with it an increase in health risks, especially for the eyes. One eye problem, called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS), is afflicting more and more people who find
                        themselves constantly in front of computer screens. While eye health professionals have yet to find CVS as a cause of any permanent eye damage, the pain and discomfort associated with the problem can affect workplace performance
                        or the enjoyment of home activities. With a few preventative measures, however, the symptoms associated with CVS can be easily erased. The General Ophthalmology Service at Scheie Eye Institute offers many techniques for preventing
                        CVS.

                    <p>Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is the most common 21st-century occupational hazard, which affects more than 70% of all computer users . CVS is a serious public health issue that results in decreased workplace productivity, higher error
                        rates, lower job satisfaction, and compromised visual ability.</p>

                        Long-sightedness, also known as hypermetropia or hyperopia is a common vision disorder. It results from the overall power of the eye not being strong enough, or the length of the eye being too short. Surgical correction is a treatment option for hypermetropia,
                        including laser eye surgery and clear lens exchange.</p><br>

                        Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which near objects appear clear, but objects farther away look blurry. It occurs when the shape of the eye — or the shape of certain parts of the eye — causes light rays to bend (refract) inaccurately.</p><br>

                        Presbyopia is the gradual loss of your eyes' ability to focus on nearby objects. It's a natural, often annoying part of aging. Presbyopia usually becomes noticeable in your early to mid-40s and continues to worsen until around age 65.</p><br>

                    <p>The prevalence of presbyopia has been estimated at nearly 80% by age 45–55 in North America with an estimated 16% of these individuals without adequate correction.</p>

                        A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye (the clear part of the eye that helps to focus light). Cataracts are very common as you get older. In fact, more than half of all Americans age 80 or older either have cataracts or have had surgery to
                        get rid of cataracts.</p><br>

                        Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. The symptoms can start so slowly that you may not notice them. The only way to find out if you have glaucoma

                        Astigmatism (uh-STIG-muh-tiz-um) is a common and generally treatable imperfection in the curvature of the eye that causes blurred distance and near vision. Astigmatism occurs when either the front surface of the eye (cornea) or the lens inside the eye
                        has mismatched curves.</p> <br>

                    <p>Astigmatism is measured in diopters. A perfect eye with no astigmatism has 0 diopters. Most people have between 0.5 to 0.75 diopters of astigmatism. People with a measurement of 1.5 or more typically need contacts or eyeglasses to
                        have clear vision

                    <p>
                        Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). If you have diabetes, it's important to
                        get a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year.</p> <br>
                    <h3>Percentage</h3><br>
                    <p> time, about 1 in 15 people with diabetes will develop DME. DME happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (a part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). </p>
